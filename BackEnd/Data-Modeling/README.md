DB uses SQL  | DB, queries are focused on collection of documents.
DB are not best fit for hierarchical data storage  | DB fits better for the hierarchical data storage

### For scalability:
In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. <br>
### For high transactional based application:
 SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data. <br>

 ### For support:
Excellent support are available for all SQL database from their vendors.
