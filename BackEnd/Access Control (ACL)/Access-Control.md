# Access Control (ACL)

## RBAC definition: 
The idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. <br>

## why we will use RBAC  ? <br>
it can in reality be easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure. <br>

## RBAC implementation 
1. Inventory your systems

2. Analyze your workforce and create roles

3. Assign people to roles

4. Never make one-off changes

5. Audit

## My opinion:

As we know if we have a company like ASAC there's a Teachers, Students, Manegers...etc, Not all of them should accses the same files for example Students shouldn't accses the option to add marks, but Teachers should and thats the idea of the RBAC is to give accses to specefic users on files or whatever.
