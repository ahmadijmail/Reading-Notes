## Big O
It's used to describe worst case senario <br>
## Input Size 
refers to the size of the parameter values that are read by the algorithm

## Worst Case, Best Case, Average Case
**Worst Case**: The efficiency for the worst possible input of size (n) <br>
**Best Case**: The efficiency for the best possible input of size (n)<br>

**Average Case**: The efficiency for a “typical” or “random” input of size (n)<br>

**Average Case**: The efficiency for a “typical” or “random” input of size (n)


## Linked Lists

 A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.(two types (Singly and Doubly.)) <br>

 ## Traversal <br>

 When traversing a linked list, you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. We depend on the Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing. The Next property is exceptionally important because it will lead us where the next node is and allow us to extract the data appropriately. <br>

## Adding a Node <br>

## Print Out Nodes 
Printing out all of the nodes in a Linked List is very similar to what we did in the Includes() method. This is because we are leveraging our Current node and a while loop to traverse through the existing linked list.
