# Bearer Authorization

## JSON Web Tokens

is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. 

## whats JSON Web Tokens is used for? 
1. Authorization:  Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.

2. Information Exchange: securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are

## JSON Web Token structure
1. Header
2. Payload
3. Signature

## Good quastion, Since I'm able to decode the JWT what's the benefit of it? 


JWTs can be either signed, encrypted or both. If a token is signed, but not encrypted, everyone can read its contents, but when you don't know the private key, you can't change it. Otherwise, the receiver will notice that the signature won't match anymore.
